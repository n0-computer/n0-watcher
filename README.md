> Watchable values.

A `Watchable` exists to keep track of a value which may change over time.  It allows
observers to be notified of changes to the value.  The aim is to always be aware of the
**last** value, not to observe *every* value change.

In that way, a `Watchable` is like a `tokio::sync::broadcast::Sender`, except that there's no risk
of the channel filling up, but instead you might miss items.
